# REGENERATIVE BRAKING
**Abstract:-** As in todayâ€™s world, where there are energy crises and the resources are depleting at a higher rate, there is a need for specific technology that recovers the energy, which usually gets wasted. So, in case of automobiles one of these useful technologies is the regenerative braking system. Generally in automobiles whenever the brakes are applied the vehicle comes to a halt and the kinetic energy gets wasted due to friction in the form of kinetic energy. Using a regenerative braking system in automobiles enables us to recover the kinetic energy of the vehicle to some extent that is lost during the braking process. Regenerative braking system can convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy with the help of an electric motor. And it can also convert the kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which is supplied to the vehicle whenever it is needed, with the help of a flywheel.
## INTORDUCTION TO REGENERATIVE BRAKING
When a conventional vehicle applies its brakes, kinetic energy is converted to heat as friction between the brake pads and wheels. This heat is carried away in the airstream and the energy is effectively wasted The total amount of energy lost in this way depends on how often, how hard and for how long the brakes are applied.

Regenerative braking refers to a process in which a portion of the kinetic energy of the vehicle is stored by a short term storage system. Energy normally dissipated in the brakes is directed by a power transmission system to the energy store during deceleration. That energy is held until required again by the vehicle, whereby it is converted back into kinetic energy and used to accelerate the vehicle. The magnitude of the portion available for energy storage varies according to the type of storage, drivetrain efficiency, drive cycle and inertia weight. A lorry on the motorway could travel 100 miles between stops. This represents little saving even if the efficiency of the system is 100%. City centre driving involves many more braking events representing a much higher energy loss with greater potential savings. With buses, taxis, delivery vans and so on there is even more potential for economy.

Since regenerative braking results in an increase in energy output for a given energy input to a vehicle, the efficiency is improved The amount of work done by the engine of the vehicle is reduced, in turn reducing the amount of prime energy required to propel the vehicle. In order for a regenerative braking system to be cost effective the prime energy saved over a specified lifetime must offset the initial cost, size and weight penalties of the system. The energy storage unit must be compact, durable and capable of handling high power levels efficiently, and any auxiliary energy transfer or energy conversion equipment must be efficient, compact and of reasonable cost.

To be successful a regenerative braking system should ideally have the following properties
- Efficient energy conversion.
- An energy store with a high capacity per unit weight and volume.
- A high power rating so large amounts of energy can flow in a short space of time.
- Not require oover complicated control systems to link it with the vehicle transmission.
- Smooth delivery of power from the regenerative system.
- Absorb and store braking energy in direct proportion to braking, with the least delay and loss over a wide range if road speeds and wheel torques.

## Electric Vehicles
Electrically driven vehicles can give a saving of energy if, with suitable control equipment, they can convert KE to electrical energy for storage and re-use. The drive motor of an electric vehicle can be made to operate as a generam supplying a resistive load and braking torque to the wheels. In regenerative braking, the electric vehicle motor operates as a generator to charge the battery. The process is less efficient at low power because of the substantial fixed  mechanical losses, thus regeneration is not possible at low speeds and must be supplemented by mechanical brakes. 

## Methods of Regeneration in Vehicles
### Hydraulic Accumulators
Hydraulic regeneration systems have been considered by the automotive industry for implementation in hybrid vehicles for a number of years. A gas charged hydraulic accumulator is a potential energy storage device in the form of a cylindrical or spherical vessel that can hold relatively large amounts of hydraulic fluid under pressure. The device stores energy by compressing a gas, and has proved to be much more practical than the weight or spring loaded type. They are also lighter, cheaper and more compact.

### Electric Motors
Induction motors produce torque based on the DIFFERENCE between the rotor speed and synchronous speed. The applied line voltage produces a rotating magnetic field whose lines of flux are cut by the squirrel cage rotor windings. When those windings cut flux lines, a current is induced that produces a rotating magnetic field. Thus you have 2 magnetic fields attracting each other. If the induction motor is sped up by an overhauling load, the difference can fall to 0 and thus no current in the rotor and thus no magnetic field in the rotor.

### Flywheels
The kinetic energy of a vehicle to be decelerated is used to accelerate a flywheel; this flywheel is subsequently coupled to the transmission to assist in starting the vehicle from rest, thus conserving energy. The kinetic energy stored in a flywheel is given by E = 1/2*J(a)square.
where J = moment of inertia and a = angular rotating speed. This energy is proportional to the rotational speed squared and by increasing this speed one can store more energy. However the 
stress in the material increases with speed squared and once the maximum tensile strength is exceeded the flywheel disintegrates. The shape of the flywheel is important and must be designed such that stress in the material is the same throughout. The specific energy density of a flywheel is proportional to the ratio of tensile strength to specific density. 

A flywheel used as an energy store will dissipate some of its stored energy continuously as friction and aerodynamic losses. The estimated practical energy density is significantly lower than the theoretical value because of the additional weight ofthe bearings, motorlgenerator, shaft and containment vessel.
The flywheel rotates in a vacuum to reduce windage losses. This vacuum would have to be checked regularly. Magnetic bearings are the only type suitable for high speed operation in a vacnut with low losses. To extract energy from a flywheel an  electrical generator is used.  When flywheels are used, the electric power generated is AC wit& variable frequency and voltage.

### Elastomeric
Elastomeric energy storage is promising because of its inherent simplicity. In theory one needs to only connect the axle or driveline to an elastomer such that the vehicle motion stresses the elastomer. All of the other energy storage systems previously considered require more complex energy transfer
equipment. In addition, the deceleration and acceleration characteristics of a system consisting of an elastomer and a clutch are similar to actual stop-start driving characteristics. There are various stressing schemes which may be implemented to enable energy storage. These include tension, shear, compression and torsion. Tension is superior on the basis of energy stored per unit of elastomer volume. However, in an automotive application, total volume is more important than elastomer volume since the total space required to accommodate the system is at a premium. In a tension scheme
a device to convert linear into rotary motion is also necessary, adding complexity and additional
volume requirements.
