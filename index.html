            <p class="justify-text">As in todayâ€™s world, where there are energy crises and the resources are depleting at a higher rate, there is a need for specific technology that recovers the energy, which usually gets wasted. So, in case of automobiles one of these useful technologies is the regenerative braking system. Generally in automobiles whenever the brakes are applied the vehicle comes to a halt and the kinetic energy gets wasted due to friction in the form of kinetic energy. Using a regenerative braking system in automobiles enables us to recover the kinetic energy of the vehicle to some extent that is lost during the braking process. Regenerative braking system can convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy with the help of an electric motor. And it can also convert the kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which is supplied to the vehicle whenever it is needed, with the help of a flywheel.</p>

            <h1 class="italic">Introduction</h1>
            <p class="justify-text">When a conventional vehicle applies its brakes, kinetic energy is converted to heat as friction between the brake pads and wheels. This heat is carried away in the airstream and the energy is effectively wasted The total amount of energy lost in this way depends on how often, how hard and for how long the brakes are applied.
            Regenerative braking refers to a process in which a portion of the kinetic energy of the vehicle is stored by a short term storage system. Energy normally dissipated in the brakes is directed by a power transmission system to the energy store during deceleration. That energy is held until required again by the vehicle, whereby it is converted back into kinetic energy and used to accelerate the vehicle. The magnitude of the portion available for energy storage varies according to the type of storage, drivetrain efficiency, drive cycle and inertia weight. </p>

            <h1 class="italic">Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="justify-text">From this analysis it can be concluded that using Regenrative Braking System fuel can be saved by a significant amount. Stopping the vehicle from high velocity will produce much better results in the fuel saving.
                Constant improvements should be carried out to increase the efficiency of the braking system as increasing the brake efficiency also leads to saving of energy which ultimately results in saving the fuel.
